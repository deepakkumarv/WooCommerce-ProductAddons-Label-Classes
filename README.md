WooCommerce-ProductAddons-Label-Classes
=======================================

The WooCommerce Product Add-Ons plugin/extension allows you to label the input fields, however, the labels themselves don't have classes. The included template files add an additional bit of code that uses the product add-ons name to create a unique label class for each input, thus allowing for much simpler styling via CSS.
